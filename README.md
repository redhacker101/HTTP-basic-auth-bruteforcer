# HTTP-basic-auth-bruteforcer
 python HTTP basic authentication bruteforce

Tips:

the python code needs a few changes, the code uses "rockyou.txt" so you have to install rockyou.txt password list on the same directory, the username defaults to "admin" and there is a commented out code to use a txt file of "usernames.txt", so if you can run a list of usernames.

How to run:

make sure to have a txt file installed with your password list and the name of the txt file in the code has to be the same.

Run: python3 bruteforce.py and add the target url. make sure to add https:// and for non https:// sites add http://
